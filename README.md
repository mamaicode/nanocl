## 🚀 Key Benefits

- Easy deployment and management
- Significantly reduce the delay between writing code and shipping it to production
- Efficiently manage and scale your infrastructure as your needs evolve
- Enhance security by isolating services using namespaces and networks.
- Enjoy peace of mind with automatic backups, zero downtime fail-over, and comprehensive log monitoring
- Enjoy history tracking of your container and virtual machine configuration
- Revert configuration as quickly as pressing a button
- Build an entire CI/CD pipeline, from tests to high-availability production
- Best ideas and practices from the community

## 🔧 Usage

`Nanocl` is designed to be easy to operate by mostly using **Statefiles**.<br />
**Statefiles** are `yaml` files that define the state you want.<br />
There is an example used to deploy our [documentation][documentation]:

```yaml
ApiVersion: v0.14

# See all options:
# https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/objects/cargo
Cargoes:
- Name: doc
  Container:
    Image: ghcr.io/next-hat/documentation:0.13.0

# See all options:
# https://docs.next-hat.com/references/nanocl/objects/resource
Resources:
- Name: docs.next-hat.com
  Kind: ncproxy.io/rule/v0.10
  Data:
    Rules:
    - Domain: docs.next-hat.com
      Network: Public
      Locations:
      - Path: /
        Target:
          Key: doc.global.c
          Port: 80
```

To apply a state we can do it easily bu running `nanocl state apply -s path|url`<br />
We can also revert a state by calling `nanocl state rm -s path|url`<br />

## 📺 Demo

## 🧿 Architecture

`Nanocl` is designed in a **micro services** architecture several component are required and they are running as **container** included the `Nanocl Daemon` itself.
The following components will be installed during `nanocl setup` and are required to ensure `Nanocl` functionality:

- `nstore` to save our state
- `ndaemon` as **REST API** to manage everything
- `nmetrics` to monitor cpu, memory and network usage
- `nproxy` proxy to redirect traffic to our **containers** and **virtual machines**
- `ncproxy` to update proxy configuration based on the current state
- `ndns` to manage the dns entries for the **containers** and **virtual machines**
- `ncdns` to update dns entries based on the current state
